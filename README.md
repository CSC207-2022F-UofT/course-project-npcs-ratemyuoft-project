**Comment**

Mason Logs in to his RateMyCourse accounts. He recently took PHL201 and wants to leave a comment detailing how boring the course is. He filters for the course and clicks on it. Once in the course he presses the leave comment button, writes his review ("This course is so boring!"), and submits it.

First off, everything starts from Comment mainframe. Which there are two options view all comments or Comment. If you press on comment. It will tell the controller, where it calls the Interactor to tell the presenter to show a new make a new UI add comment frame. Next you can enter a comment. By pressing enter, the common string will then send to the controller. Which turned into a input data and send it to the interactor and pass it to the gateway and save it.
Meanwhile, the Interactor will call the output boundary. Which the UI will send it out. 

The other option in the mainframe is view comment. Once it's pressed it will send the signal, through Controller to interactor. 
Which gets all the comments from the database and turn it into an Output data and send it to the presenter. Then the presenter will create a new frame that display all the Comments.
